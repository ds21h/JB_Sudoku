Version 0.1 - 13-02-2019
-   First version

Version 1.0 - 09-03-2019
-   Complete game
-   two ways to create games:
    -   Generator
        Really creates random game
        Difficulty only very approximative
        Very cpu intensive so can take some time (especially in the harder levels)
    -   Library
        Uses previously stored game as seed
-   Has Setup mode to enter game from other source
-   Can store manually entered or generated games to use as seed
-   Has solver
-   User interface in English and Dutch

Version 1.1 - 30-01-2020
-   Multiple playing fields
    - Extra menu option to manage PlayFields
    - Functions: Clone current PlayField in a new one, Switch between PlayFields and Delete current Playfield
    - Playfield 0 cannot be deleted
    - If multiple playfields exist an indicator is included under the playfield.

Version 1.1.1 - 20-02-2020
-   After deleting a playfield the highest remaining playfield is selected instead of 0.

Version 1.1.2 - 23-02-2020
-   Changed saving strategy. It appeared that saving didn't always function well. Probably because too much work was done during OnPause.
    Now saving is more proactive:
    -   When new game is created the whole saved game is deleted
    -   When leaving the focus of a PlayField (clone or switch) the 'old' PlayField is saved
    -   When deleting a PlayField the saved version is also deleted
    -   In the OnPause function only the current PlayField is saved

Version 1.1.3 - 17-08-2020 - Not yet published
-   On creating a new game (setup, generate or library) the field_id of the remaining playfield is reset to 0. Otherwise an error hereof (should not be possible) will never be corrected.

Version 1.2 - 05-11-2020
-   Minimum API level changed to 19 (Android 4.4 - KitKat)
-   Changed compatibility libraries to AndroidX
-   Split SudokuGame in two Classes:
    - SudokuGameBase which has all the playing functionality
    - SudokuGame which inherits SudokuGameBase and has all the multi-Playfield functionality
-   Moved the save action from onPause to onStop
-   Moved the restore action from onResume to onStart
-   Save actions are now processed on a different thread in order to enhance responsiveness
-   AutoPencil mode can be turned off
-   When auto pencil is enabled and a cellselection is changed or erased (not added!) all pencilentries are erased as they then become unreliable.
-   Exception: When an empty cell is filled and marked as erroneous en then erased the pencil entries are not erased.

Version 1.2.1 - 18-02-2021
-   Introduced transactions on the DB. The multi-threaded approach introduced in Version 1.2 sometimes caused problems with simultaneous access.
